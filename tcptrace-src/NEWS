tcptrace (6.6.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * As of version 6.6.7-2, tcptrace recommends xplot-xplot.org rather
    than gnuplot, now that the former is included with Debian.  This
    recommendation is more consistent with the upstream developers
    intentions.  xpl2gpl is still included for those who would prefer to
    continue using gnuplot.
